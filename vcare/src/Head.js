               Imaging studies may include X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan of the head. The preferred diagnostic imaging test is CT scan because it can show highly detailed images of the bone, tissue, and other structures in the head. Also, these imaging studies are used to check for possible injury to the brain."
