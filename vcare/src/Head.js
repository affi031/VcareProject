               info1="Blocked arteries, ruptured blood vessels, or blood clots can cause a stroke.

               Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) may help with stroke prevention and recovery. Examples of CAM treatments include massage, dietary supplements, or acupuncture to manage stress.

               According to a 50-year study of strokes in India, where strokes are more common than in Western countries, managing the risk factors of stroke was the best option for prevention. One-third of the participants made education and lifestyle changes to control their risk factors. These changes proved to be the most effective way to prevent another stroke in this group.

               Evidence doesn’t suggest that CAM treatments are better than medical treatments. In fact, CAM treatments haven’t been as well-studied as standard therapies. So CAM treatments shouldn’t replace any treatments your doctor has prescribed. If you think you’re having a stroke, call 911 or your local emergency services.

               But adding CAM treatments to your healthcare routine may help you reach health goals. For example, it may help lower your blood pressure faster.

               Check with your doctor first before trying CAM treatments."

when to see a doctor:Chemotherapy (often abbreviated to chemo and sometimes CTX or CTx) is a type of cancer treatment that uses one or more anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapeutic agents) as part of a standardized chemotherapy regimen. Chemotherapy may be given with a curative intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim to prolong life or to reduce symptoms (palliative chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of the medical discipline specifically devoted to pharmacotherapy for cancer, which is called medical oncology.[1][2]

The term chemotherapy has come to connote non-specific usage of intracellular poisons to inhibit mitosis (cell division) or induce DNA damage, which is why inhibition of DNA repair can augment chemotherapy.[3] The connotation of the word chemotherapy excludes more selective agents that block extracellular signals (signal transduction). The development of therapies with specific molecular or genetic targets, which inhibit growth-promoting signals from classic endocrine hormones (primarily estrogens for breast cancer and androgens for prostate cancer) are now called hormonal therapies. By contrast, other inhibitions of growth-signals like those associated with receptor tyrosine kinases are referred to as targeted therapy.
